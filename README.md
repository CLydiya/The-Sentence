    <h1>The Sentence</h1>
    <h2>What is a sentence?</h2>
    <p>Grammar deals with the rules for combining words into larger units. The largest unit is described in grammar is normally the sentence. You may therefore think that grammarians shouldbe embarrassed ar not being able to offer a simple definition of
        the term 'sentence'. <br> It is sometimes said that a sentence expresses a complete thought. This is a <strong>notional</strong> definition: it defines a term by the notion or idea it conveys. The difficulty with this definition lies in fixingwhat
        is meant by a 'complete thought'. There are notices, for example, that seems to be complete in themselves but are not generally regarded as sentences: Exit, Danger, 50 mph limiy. <br> On the other hand, there are sentences that clearly consistof
        more than one thought. Here is one relatively simple example: <br>
        <blockquote>This week marks the 300th anniversary of the publication of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophiac Naturalis Principia Mathematica, a fundamental work for the whole of modern science and a key influence on the philosophy of the European Enlightenment.</blockquote>
        <br> How many 'complete thoughts' are there in this sentence? We should at least recognize that the part after the comma introduces two additional points about Newton's book: <br>
        <ol>
            <li>that it is a fundamental work for the whole time of modern science</li>
            <li>that it was a key influence on the philosophy of the Euopean Enlightenment.</li>
        </ol><br> Yet this example would be acknowledged by all as a single sentence, and it is written as a single sentence. <br> We can try another approach by defining a sentence as a string of words beginning with a capital letter and ending with a full
        stop. This is a <strong>formal</strong> definition: it defines a term by the form or shape of what the term refers to. We can at once see that as it stands this definition is inadequate, since: <br>
        <ol>
            <li>many sentences end with a question mark or an exclamation</li>
            <li>capital letters are used for nmaes, and full stop are used for abbreviations.</li>
        </ol><br> Even if we amend the definition to take account of these objections, we still find strings of words in newspaper headlines, titles, and notices that everyone would recognize as sentences even though they do not end with a full srop, a question
        mark, or an exclamation mark: <br>
        <blockquote>Tress May Be a Source of Pollution<br> An Irish Airman Foresees his Death (title of poem)<br> Do not enter</blockquote><br> But the most serious objection is that the definition is directed only towards the <strong>Orthography</strong> sentences,
        that is, sentences that appear in the written language. Spoken sentences, of course, do not have capital letters amd periods. <br>It is in fact far more difficult to determine the limits of sentences in natural conversation, to say where sentences
        begin and end. That is so partly because people may change direction as they speak and partly because they tend to make heavy use of connectors such as <i>and, but, so,</i> and <i>then</i>. Here is a typical example of a speaker who strings snetences
        together with <i>and</i>. (The full stop marks a short pause and the dash marks a longer pause. The vertical line marks the end of a rhythmic unit in the intonation.)<br>
        <blockquote>I'd been working away this week| trying to clear up| . the backlog of mail| caused by me being three weeks away| . and I thought I was doing marvellously| . six o'clock last night| . I was sorting through . stuff on the desk| and I discovered
            . a fat pile of stuffs - all carefully opened| and documented by Sally| that I hadn't even seen| .</blockquote><br> How many orthographic sentences correspond to the story? There is no one correct answer. In writing it we have a choice:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>we could punctuate it as one sentence</li>
            <li>we could split it into two or more sentences, each of the later sentences begin with <i>and</i></li>
        </ol><br> Grammarians are not worried about the difficulties in defining the sentence. Their approach to the question is formal because they are interested in the grammatical form. Like many people who are not grammarians, they are generally confident
        of recognizing sentences, and they specify the possible patterns for the sentences. Combination of words that conform to those patterms are then <strong>grammatical</strong> sentences.</p>
     <h2>Irregular sentences and non-sentences</h2>
    <p>Sentences that conform to the major patterns are <strong>regular</strong> sentences, and they are the type that will generally concern us in this passage. Sentences that do not conform to the major patterns are <strong>irregular</strong> sentences.
        <br>If I ask you to write down the first sentences that come into your mind, you are likely to produce regular sentences. Here are some regular sentences in various major patterns:<br>
        <blockquote>David and Doris have three sons. <br>The liquid smelled spicy to Justin. <br>Some people give their children a daily dose of vitamins. <br>About a million visitors come to our city every summer.</blockquote><br>Most irregular sentences are <strong>fragmentary</strong>        sentences. These leave out words that we easily supply, usually from the proceeding verbal context. Here is a typical example in an exchange between two speakers: <br>
        <blockquote>A: Where did you put the letter? <br>B: In the top drawer.</blockquote><br> We interpret B's reply as <i>I put the letter in the top drawer</i>, and that reconstructed sentence would be regular. Similarly, the headline <i>Same gun used in IRA attacks</i>        corresponds to the regular <i>The same gun was used in the IRA attacks.</i> Fragmentary sentences can therefore be viewed as directly derivable in their interpretation from regular sentences.><br> Finally, we often say or write theings that are
        not grammatical sentences. These non-sentences may simply be mistakes. But they may also be perfwctly normal, although they cannot be analyzed grammatically as sentences. Normal non-sentences include such common expression as <i>Hello!; Yes; No; Solong!; Thanks!; Cheers!;</i>        and they include many headlines, headings, titles, labels and notices: <br>
        <blockquote>Jail Riot (headline) <br>On the Nature of the Model (section heading in book)<br>The Captain and the Enemy (title of book)<br>Naming of Parts (title of poem)<br>Pure Lemon Juice<br>No Smoking<br></blockquote>In the next chapter, we will be lopking
        at the patterns of regular sentences, but first I have a few more general things to say about sentences.</p>
